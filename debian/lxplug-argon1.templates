Description: Restarting lxpanel
 If lxpanel is already running, it will not pick up new plugins. Therefore,
 if you are already logged in to a graphical session, you need to restart it.
 You can either open a terminal and issue the command
    lxpanelctl restart
 or you can simply log out and log back in.
